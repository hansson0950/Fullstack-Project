# Fullstack-Project Fresh Food

### Project Description
Fresh Food works as a food/grocery ordering service. On the website you can create or login to an account.
This will then forward you to an ordering page where you can choose the products you want to order as well as the amount of each product.
Once you have finished choosing, there is a checkout option that gives you a receipt of the order.

MongoDB is used as the database to store data on products, users, orders and more.
The application is deployed to the cloud using Heroku.

### How To Install And Run
To run the application as a user all you need to to use the link to the website: https://fullstack-project-2022.herokuapp.com/

### How To Use
Once on the application, get started by creating an account or logging in to an existing one.
This will redirect you to the ordering page where you can add the amount you want of the available products.
Amount can be incremented or decremented using '+' and '-' buttons, or it can be manually written into a textbox.
After choosing what products you want, press checkout to be redirected to another page displaying a receipt of the order.
